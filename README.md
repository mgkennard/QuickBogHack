QuickBogHack
============

A quick hack whilst dinner is simmering so I can play a derivative of a famous word game (Boggle) which involves shaking a box with cubes, each side of which contains a letter. See the link below for the rules. I didn't want a version of the game to play on the iPad - just the board, I will use paper to write down the discovered words.

The letter distribution was taken from <http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/300565/review-from-a-boggle-veteran-and-beware-differen> - the original version!
